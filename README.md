# Leafy
Web application that helps you keep track of your meals, the grocery shopping list and much more.

<hr>
Leafy is a web application I built using React.js, Redux.js, React Router, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js. It is a meal planning app where users can fetch recipes through an API and save them in their weekly menu. Once the recipes are saved and stored in a database, the items listed as the ingredients are added to a shopping list, which can be edited entirely.

The app also has an authentication system in which the user must provide an e-mail and password to access the web app.

The design of the web page was created using Illustrator.
